            <p>Government of Pakistan is taking all necessary steps to ensure that we are prepared well to face the
                challenge and threat posed by the growing pandemic of COVID 19 – the Corona Virus. With active
                support of the people of Pakistan, we have been able to contain the spread of the Virus in our country.
                The most important factor in preventing the spread of the Virus locally is to empower the citizens
                with the right information and taking precautions as per the advisories being issued by Ministry of
                Health & Family Welfare.</p>

                <h3>How long does the Covid-19 vaccine last?</h3>
                <p>
                    <li> So far, Pfizer's ongoing trial indicates the company's two-dose vaccine remains highly
                        effective for at
                        least six months, and likely longer. People who got Moderna's vaccine also still had notable
                        levels of
                        virus-fighting antibodies six months after the second required shot. </li>

            <div class="questions">
                <h3>Can COVID-19 spread through food?</h3>
                <p>
                    <li>There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread through contact with food or food packaging.
                        COVID-19 is
                        generally thought to be spread from person to person. However, it’s always important to practice
                        good
                        hygiene when handling food to prevent any food-borne illnesses.</li>

            <div class="questions">
                <h3>What are foods to avoid during the COVID-19 pandemic?</h3>
                <p>
                    <li>Reduce foods such as red and fatty meats, butter and full-fat dairy products, palm oil, coconut
                        oil, solid shortening and lard. Avoid trans fats as much as possible. Read nutrition labels to
                        ensure that partially hydrogenated oils are not listed in the ingredients</li>

            <div class="questions">
                <h3>Who is most at risk for COVID-19?</h3>
                <p>
                    <li>COVID-19 is often more severe in people 60+yrs or with health conditions like lung or heart
                        disease, diabetes or conditions that affect their immune system.​</li>

            <div class="questions">
                <h3>Can I get the coronavirus disease from swimming in a swimming pool?</h3>
                <p>
                    <li>Swimming in a well-maintained, properly chlorinated pool is safe. However, it is advisable to
                        stay away from al crowded areas including crowded swimming pools. Keep 1 metre distance from
                        people who sneeze or cough even in a swimming area.</li>

            <div class="questions">
                <h3>Is a smoker at a higher risk of getting the COVID-19 virus than that a non-smoker?</h3>
                <p>
                    <li> At the time of preparing this Q&A, there are no peer-reviewed studies that have evaluated the
                        risk of
                        SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with smoking. However, tobacco smokers (cigarettes, waterpipes,
                        bidis,
                        cigars, heated tobacco products) may be more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19, as the act of
                        smoking
                        involves contact of fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) with the lips, which
                        increases the
                        possibility of transmission of viruses from hand to mouth. Smoking waterpipes, also known as
                        shisha or
                        hookah, often involves the sharing of mouth pieces and hoses, which could facilitate the
                        transmission of
                        the COVID-19 virus in communal and social settings.</li>
